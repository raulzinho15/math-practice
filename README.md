# raul-math-practice
A timed mathematics game that strengthens skills in arithmetic and algebra.

To play, compile the .java files, and run the class compiled from the src/app/GUI.java file. This will open the main math practice screen. From there, choose the arithmetic/algebra skill you would like to practice. A timer will begin, measuring the time you take to answer each question. There is also an accuracy tracker to see how well you have been answering the questions. To answer a question, simply click on the rectangular box containing the answer choice you think is correct. Then, rinse and repeat!

All the code used was authored by Raul Hernandez in 2020 using Eclipse IDE.
